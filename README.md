Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples
include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1.About setting the height of each cell according to the overview
2.About adding a filter according to the types of the movies

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Had a lot of trouble trying to adjust the height of each cell. I tried the typical function for 
setting the height, but somehow it totally skipped the function. So I hard-coded it at last. 
So this is something I need to update in the future.
